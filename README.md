## About <a name = "about"></a>

- This is the capstone project of the Microverse Ruby on Rails curriculum. This capstone project is completed as part of the Microverse remote software developement curriculum using the pair programming approach.
- In this project I created a saving app where users can create an account with their username and add their savings. The savings can be grouped and ungrouped into the names of their choice.
- At Sign up, users can select their preferred image for better UI and UX.

- Users can also view each savings in each group.

- Users can track the total amount of their savings.

- This project is built with the MVP approach
